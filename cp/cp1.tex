\section{Introduction}
The Demand-Driven Cycamore Archetype project (NEUP-FY16-10512) aims to develop \Cycamore demand-driven deployment capabilities.
The project plans to use non-optimizing, deterministic-optimizing and stochastic-optimizing prediction algorithms.

These prediction models are being developed by the University of South Carolina. In this report, we discuss numerical experiments for testing the non-optimizing, deterministic optimizing and stochastic optimizing methods. The numerical experiments will be designed for both the once through nuclear fuel cycle and advanced fuel cycles. 

\section{Once through Nuclear Fuel Cycle}
\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Flow Chart of Once through Nuclear Fuel Cycle}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=3.5cm]
\node (source) [process] {\texttt{Source}};
\node (enrichment) [process, right of=source] {\texttt{Enrichment}};
\node (fuelfab) [process, right of=enrichment] {\texttt{FuelFab}};
\node (reactor) [process, right of=fuelfab]{\texttt{Reactor}};
\node (sink) [process, right of=reactor]{\texttt{Sink}};

\draw [arrow] (source) -- (enrichment); 
\draw [arrow] (enrichment) -- (fuelfab); 
\draw [arrow] (fuelfab) -- (reactor);
\draw [arrow] (reactor) -- (sink);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

In this report, the once-through fuel cycle is simplified to have 5 components: \texttt{Source}, \texttt{Enrichment}, \texttt{FuelFab}, \texttt{Reactor} and \texttt{Sink}. However, in a true once-through fuel cycle, there are more than 5 components. Other components include milling, conversion etc. For example, if a fuel cycle includes the milling step and excludes the \texttt{FuelFab} step, the tests can be modified to include milling and exclude \texttt{FuelFab}. 

\subsection{Input File Specification}
\Cyclus uses XML input files. For the input file, we assume the archetype to be an \texttt{INSTITUTION}, since it governs deployment and decommission of facilities.

The user would only have to define the reactor prototype and reactor deployment. 
The remaining fuel facilities,
both front end and back end, would be recognized by the archetype
by looking at each prototypes' in-and-out commodities.
Then the recognized, or `connected' fuel cycle facilities deploy
with demand.
If an input file does not have the necessary `connections' for the 
reactor to receive fuel, it will throw an error. 

We suggest an example format:
First, the input file would define reactor prototype to be deployed. There can be multiple reactors.

\begin{minted}{xml}
<institution>
      <name>NO_ddd</name>
       <config><NO_ddd/></config>
      <reactor_list>
        <val>lwr</val>
        <val>sfr</val>
        <val>mox_lwr</val>
      </reactor_list>
\end{minted}

Then deployment of the reactors is defined, and the user
is given the option to manually define the deployment(DeployInst):
\begin{minted}{xml}
      <deployment>
      <type>manual</type>

        <build_times>
          <val>1</val>
          <val>10</val>
          <val>20</val>
          <val>40</val>
        </build_times>
        <n_build>
          <val>3</val>
          <val>3</val>
          <val>3</val>
          <val>3</val>
        </n_build>
        <lifetimes>
          <val>960</val>
          <val>960</val>
          <val>960</val>
          <val>960</val>
        </lifetimes>
      </deployment>

    </institution>
\end{minted}

Or have the institution deploy reactors according to power demand (GrowthRegion):

\begin{minted}{xml}
      <deployment>
      <type>growth</type>

      <growth>
        <piecewise_function>
              <piece>
                <start>0</start>
                <function>
                  <type>linear</type>
                  <params>1 2</params>
                </function>
              </piece>
        </piecewise_function>
      </growth>
      
      </deployment>

    </institution>
\end{minted}

\subsection{Simple Scenario for Testing}

A simple scenario definition is given where a predefined \texttt{Reactor}
is deployed at timestep one and three. The chain of front---end
fuel cycle facility of one facility each 
(\texttt{Source}, \texttt{Enrichment}, \texttt{FuelFab}) can supply enough fuel
for the operation of one reactor. A \texttt{Sink} can hold enough
amount for two batches of fuel. The specifics are listed below:
